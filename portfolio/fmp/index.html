            <p>At the end of my first year at Bath College, I was tasked with a Final Major Project which is a project which I was left alone to ideate, execute, and submit to be graded. I chose the brand Fear of God to rebrand since the brand was rather flexible in how it was represented, and as a base had rather minimalistic branding. I also was inspired by some work by <a href="https://www.joerperez.com/fear-of-god-x-vans/" target="_blank">Joe Perez.</a> I wanted to make the brand a more high-speed high-energy visual whilst still aligning with the brand values and ethos.</p>
