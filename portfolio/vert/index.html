            <p><a href="https://vert.sh/">VERT.sh</a> is a file conversion website made by a friend of mine with the aim of being the most secure, and business friendly one available the web which was achieved by processing files locally in the browser as opposed to on some offshore server, meaning it is faster than the other sites, and far more secure and GDPR friendly. It is also Open Source which ensures transparency and allows peopele from around the world to aid with the development.<br>
            My job on this project has been creating and executing the branding, and marketing alongside helping out with the user experience as new features were added to the website.<br>
            I created the VERT logo based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241207080050/https://vert.sh/">rough prototype logo that the project was using in beta</a> that was created by the UI Designer. The updated logo uses our display font alongside a geometric cut in the V shape, symbolising cutting out the middleman of a server.<br>
            With marketing, we wanted more awareness for the project that wasn't just Twitter posts by the developers as the target audience is more oriented towards professional settings. To do this, I emailled various press outlets that covered Open Source projects presenting the project as something that could help the editors in-office, but also as something they could cover on their site if they genuinely found it useful. Alongside this, I made a post to Hacker News presenting the website as just a cool tool, not an advertisement. These attempts were massively successful. The post to Hacker News reached the #1 spot for the majority of the day, causing a spike of 21 thousand users for that day, the highest we have ever had. We also managed to get covered by various press outlets like LifeHacker, XDA, and FastCompany. All of this has accumulated to a daily average of 2.7k users.</p>
