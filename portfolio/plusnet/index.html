            <p>During my second year at Bath College, I was tasked with rebranding a brand of my own choice. After evaluating the brands that came to mind, I chose Plusnet since it had the least strong branding and little to no brand equity whilst having strong potential.
               After conducting research on the current plusnet brand and my own thoughts on broadband branding, I explored logo concepts using Adobe Illustrator. My main goal was to invent a logo that was both distinctive and meaningful. This led to the creation of several candidates, the most successful being a "plus person" pictogram that cleverly combined the plus sign motif with the shape of a person. I refined this design through numerous iterations, experimenting with the balance and proportion of its elements and seeking feedback from peers to ensure it was recognisable and effective. Below you can find the final presentation document I submitted.
