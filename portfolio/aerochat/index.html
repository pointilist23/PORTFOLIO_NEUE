                <p>Aerochat is a third party Discord Client made by nullptr which replicates the look of 2009's MSN Messenger 1:1.
                <br>The project started originally as WebApp, however it underwent a rewrite to run natively under WPF, which allowed for faster speeds and far easier implementing of custom assets and user customisation options.
                <br>This is where my role came in. I was tasked making new custom, but period-realistic "<a href="https://windowswallpaper.miraheze.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger#Windows_Live_Messenger_2009" target="_blank">scenes</a>" that people could use as their user banner. These scenes had to fit a strict size format and be simultaneously generic, but appealing to users of the software who would want to choose these to represent themselves.
                <br>When the relaunch happened, these scenes were originally the only unique customisation additions to the software, however we later decided to allow the community to submit their own designs, and for this I also made a <a href="https://testing.duckwithsunglasses.com/Scene/">Scene Previewer</a> and user guidelines template.</p>
