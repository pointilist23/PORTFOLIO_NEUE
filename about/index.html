            <p>I am Liam Ribeiro. I am a multimedia designer based in the UK, focusing on Graphic Design, Brand Design, and Advertising.<br><br>
            I have been studying design at Bath college, where I have recieved a UAL Diploma in Creative Media Production, I am also on track to recieving an Extended Diploma in the same field, with hopes to go on to studying at university.<br><br>
            I love design. I am always noticing logos, advertisements and brands - they fascinate and inspire me and have done since I was young. I have been using Photoshop and other creative software since I was about 11 years old, and have been honing in my craft independently, and professionally since then.
            Alongside professionally, I also create and design in my free time for fun. I love the process and outcome of art and visual development, and enjoy exploring different mediums of design and different methods of creating old, and new effects. I am always looking for new styles and visuals.<br><br>
            My first ever professional creative experience was at a signage company designing signage and vehicle wraps for customers in the local trade. Alongside designing the signs, I also prepared artwork for printing and application. I was also trained on how signage was created as well as how to use CorelDRAW.<br>
            Since then, I have also had Work Experience at the National Trust, creating social media marketing materials for some of their sites, and creating clips showcasing interviews about the upcoming 2027 reopening of the Assembly Rooms.<br><br>
            I also research design in my own free time. I enjoy researching artists and their work, along with companies and their marketing campaigns, seeing who was responsible for the work, along with any creative development and extras from the campaign. I think it's really interesting to see the process of work that I look up to and am inspired by, seeing the development process also serves as good inspiration.
